# Intro to Using R
x = 3 #assigns the number 3 to variable x
y = 56 #assigns the number 56 to variable y
z = x*y
# we will be using "=" in this class
# we can also do basic math in R
z = x*y #this creates variable z; a product of x multiplied by y
z #if I type a variable name, I can see it in the console (environment tab)
# we can do other maths
z = sqrt(y)
z = sqrt(x+y)
Z = X*pi #certain variables like pi are already in R
z = log(y, base =10) # take log of y using base exponent 10
z = log(y) # this is the natural log
z = log10(y) # this is also log_10 of y

#Part 2: Introduction to Packages
###############################################
#install.packages('tidyverse') # this installs the tidyverse package from online, you need quotes for install packages
#library(tidyverse)# the library function loads our package tidyverse, no quotes needed for library
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("munsell")
# I only need to install once, no need to keep the code here

##### Lets import our data

beacon = read_csv("beacon_data.csv")
View(beacon_data) # opens your data frame for viewing
spec(beacon)
names(beacon) # tells us column names of beacon
spec(beacon) # shows you what type of data each column is
dim(beacon) #gives us dimension of dataset
class(beacon) # types of variable not used very much
head(beacon) #shows us first 6 lines of dataset
tail(beacon) #shows us last 6 lines of dataset

# if I want access just one of those variables, I can use the $ operator

sites = beacon$ReefSiteName #creates a variable names sites, by extracting on the ReefSiteName variable from beacon
view (sites) # display sites variable
sites # display sites in console window
# yes it worked

# I can also perform operators on columns
max(beacon$Temperature) #reports a NA value
beacon$Temperature # there are both NA and NaN
max(beacon$Temperature,na.rm = TRUE)
# using the $ notation, I can also select variables and do operations with them 
beacon$nope = beacon$Temperature + beacon$Salinity

#Part 3: Data Wrangling (dplyr Functions)
###############################################
beacon = read_csv("beacon_data.csv")
select(beacon, ReefSiteName:Temperature)
# how to use select
df1 = select(beacon, ReefSiteName:Temperature) # selects columns from beacon dataframe only ReefSiteName through temperature and stores it as a new dataframe df1 # : notation is the same for numbers and in this case returns all columns between and including ReefSiteName and Temperature 
select(beacon, !Temperature) # #exclamation point means dont select that column
view (df1)

# heres how we can use filter
?filter
filter(df1, ReefSiteName == "B33") # only selects reefsite B33
# but I can combine filters
df2 = filter(df1,ReefSiteName == "B33" & DecimalDate >=2010 & DecimalDate <2011) 
# filters so that only rows are retained if the ReefSiteName column is 'B33' and year is 2010 or greated and year is less than 2011, stores as a new data frame as 'df2'

view(df2)
?arrange
df3 = arrange(df2, ReefSiteName,Temperature) # arrange data first by alphabetical order in ReefSiteName column then by ascending value in Temperature column, save as new dataframe df3

view(df3) # always view to check work

?mutate

df4 = mutate(df3, DegreesKelvin = Temperature + 273.15) #adds a new column called DegreesKelvin to 'df3' is temp (*C) plus 273.15 in a new dataframe df4
head(df4)

summary(df4) # provide summary statistics of our data
#if for example, the DecimalDate was characters instead of numbers, we can force R to change this

df4$DecimalDate = as.numeric(df4$DecimalDate) # replace DecimalDate column with a version of DecimaldDate that is characters

class(df4$DecimalDate) # now confirms that is a character
df4$DecimalDate = as.numeric(df4$DecimalDate) # replace DecimalDate

# this might seem inefficien, we wrote 30 lines of code to select columns and sort them and do some math on them  --> theres an easier way to do this thats much easier to follow and understand in code. Its called "piping"

# What if we wanted to keep columns ReefSiteName, Decimal Date, and Temperature, then arrange by low to high temperatures? we could follow the same process as before or use piping

# the piping operator is %>% control+shift+m (pc) or command+shift+m (mac)

# the %>% operator is a way of saying "and then,,,"

beacon_temps = beacon %>% 
  filter(DecimalDate>= 2010 & DecimalDate<=2011) %>% #filter for only 2010 and then
  select(ReefSiteName,DecimalDate,Temperature) # select only these columns
# we'll save this as a new data frame called beacon_temps
view(beacon_temps)
# it can also be good to check each line in a a piping operation to make sure everything is doing what you would like it to do 

# Take Beacon Data
# Select all data after 2011
# I only want only the data from MP site
# Only Salinity Data (nothing else)
# Arrange it from low to high
# subtract 30 from salinity data
# what is the mean of modified salinity data
